To build Mac OSX installers you need to setup your build environment
first.  MacPorts can be used for this.

The macports-setup-dev-env.sh script sets up your build environment.
It'll take a long time to run.

Once it's complete, running this from the command-prompt
generates git-cola.app:

	$ make git-cola.app
