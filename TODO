Short-term:
	Complete the branch menu
	Documentation, homepage

Medium-term:
	Options dialog and save/restore:
		We can leverage the Model class for this since
		it already has a JSON serializer.
		JSON is probably a good-enough format for .ugitrc.

Long-term:
	OpenGL-based commit/cherry-pick browser?
		(think node-based ala Shake or Nuke)
	StGit integration?
