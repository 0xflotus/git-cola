About
-----
**qtpy** is an abstraction layer that lets you write applications
using a single api to call PyQt and PySide.

It provides support for PyQt5, PyQt4 and PySide using the PyQt5 layout (where
the QtGui module has been split into QtGui and QtWidgets).

Basically, you write your code as if you were using PyQt5 but import qt from
``qtpy`` instead of ``PyQt5``.
