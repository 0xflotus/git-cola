About
-----
**QtPy** (pronounced *'cutie pie'*) is an abstraction layer that lets you
write applications using a single api call to PyQt and PySide. **QtPy** also
provides a set of additional QWidgets.

It provides support for PyQt5, PyQt4 and PySide using the PyQt5 layout (where
the QtGui module has been split into QtGui and QtWidgets).

Basically, you write your code as if you were using PyQt5 but import qt from
``qtpy`` instead of ``PyQt5``.
