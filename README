REQUIREMENTS

Python 2.4 or newer
	http://python.org/

GitPython
	http://gitorious.org/projects/git-python/

PyQt 4.3 or newer
	http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro


INSTALLATION

Debian and RPM users can download freshly built binaries here:

	http://cola.tuxfamily.org/

	sudo dpkg -i cola_*.deb
	sudo rpm -ivh cola-*.rpm


If you downloaded a tarball, make sure /path/to/cola/bin is in your $PATH.


HOW TO RUN

Take your pick--any of the following incantations work from the command line:

	git cola
	git-cola
	cola

Launching cola on repositories outside your $CWD:

	git cola /repo/path-1 /repo/path-2 .. /repo/path-N


BUILDING FROM SOURCE

You will need the PyQt development tools (v4.3 or greater):

Synopsis:
	sudo apt-get install pyqt4-dev-tools
	git clone git://gitorious.org/git-cola/mainline.git cola
	cd cola
	./configure --prefix=/usr
	make
	sudo make install


WINDOWS SUPPORT

Windows support once was quite experimental with git.
These days it's actually quite good and only getting better
everyday.  As git's windows support improves, so does cola's.

The following is the combination that "works for me" (TM)
as of late 2007:

1) Install the native Python2.5 and PyQt4 installers (in that order):

	http://python.org/download/
	http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/download.php

3) Install git (the author had the best luck with msysgit):

	http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/WindowsInstall

4) Install GitPython
	http://gitorious.org/projects/git-python/

5) Download and unpack cola:

	http://cola.tuxfamily.org/releases/

6) Install cola:

Copy the cola modules to the Python directory (from a git bash):

	cp -r cola-win32-x.x.x/share/cola /c/Python25/Lib/site-packages

Put the cola script somewhere permanent:

	cp cola-win32-x.x.x/bin/git-cola /c/Git/bin

(Optional) Create a batch file to run cola in your path:
	echo 'c:\\Python25\\python.exe c:\\Git\\bin\\git-cola' \
	> /c/Windows/System32/cola.bat

(Optional) Create a git bash script to run cola:
	echo '/c/Python25/python.exe /c/Git/bin/git-cola' > /usr/bin/cola

voila, cola on Windows.


NOTE: Windows is not the developer's primary platform.
Patches are greatly appreciated.
