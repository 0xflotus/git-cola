REQUIREMENTS

Python 2.4 or newer
PyQt 4.3 or newer


INSTALLATION

Debian and RPM users can download freshly built binaries here:

	http://ugit.sf.net/

	sudo dpkg -i ugit_*.deb
	sudo rpm -ivh ugit-*.rpm


If you downloaded a tarball, make sure /path/to/ugit/bin is in your $PATH.


HOW TO RUN

Take your pick--any of the following incantations work from the command line:

	git ugit
	git-ugit
	ugit

Launching ugit on repositories outside your $CWD:

	git ugit /repo/path-1 /repo/path-2 .. /repo/path-N


BUILDING FROM SOURCE

You will need the PyQt development tools (v4.3 or greater):

Synopsis:
	sudo apt-get install pyqt4-dev-tools

	git clone git://repo.or.cz/ugit.git
	cd ugit
		./configure --prefix=/usr
		make
		sudo make install


WINDOWS SUPPORT

Windows support once was quite experimental with git.
These days it's actually quite good and only getting better
everyday.  As git's windows support improves, so does ugit's.

The following is the combination that "works for me" (TM)
as of late 2007:

1) Install the native Python2.5 and PyQt4 installers (in that order):

	http://python.org/download/
	http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/download.php

3) Install git (the author had the best luck with msysgit):

	http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/WindowsInstall

4) Download and unpack ugit:

	http://ugit.sf.net/releases/

Grab the latest win32 tarball and run ugit-win32.sh from
within an msysgit or cygwin shell.

The script assumes the you have Python/PyQt4 installed in C:/Python25.
If this is not the case simply edit the script accordingly.

voila, ugit on Windows.


NOTE: Windows is not the developer's primary platform.
Patches are always greatly appreciated.
