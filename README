REQUIREMENTS

Python 2.4 or newer
	http://python.org/

GitPython
	http://gitorious.org/projects/git-python/

PyQt 4.3 or newer
	http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro


INSTALLATION

Debian and RPM users can download freshly built binaries here:

	http://cola.tuxfamily.org/

	sudo dpkg -i cola_*.deb
	sudo rpm -ivh cola-*.rpm


If you downloaded a tarball, make sure /path/to/cola/bin is in your $PATH.


HOW TO RUN

Take your pick--any of the following incantations work from the command line:

	git cola
	git-cola
	cola

Launching cola on repositories outside your $CWD:

	git cola /repo/path-1 /repo/path-2 .. /repo/path-N


BUILDING FROM SOURCE

You will need the PyQt development tools (v4.3 or greater):

Synopsis:
	sudo apt-get install pyqt4-dev-tools
	git clone git://gitorious.org/git-cola/mainline.git cola
	cd cola
	./configure --prefix=/usr
	make
	sudo make install


WINDOWS INSTALLATION

1) Install the native Python2.5 and PyQt4 installers (in that order):

	http://python.org/download/
	http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/download.php

3) Install msysgit:

	http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/WindowsInstall

4) Install GitPython

	http://gitorious.org/projects/git-python/

5) Install the GnuWin32 'file' command:

	http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/file.htm

	Add the installed directory (default: c:\GnuWin32\bin) to your path.

5) Download cola:

	http://cola.tuxfamily.org/releases/

6) Install cola (from a Git Bash):

	cd /c/Python25/Lib/site-packages
	tar xvfz /path/to/cola-win32-*.tar.gz
	mv cola-win32-* cola

7) Create an executable in your path for bash, cmd.exe, or both:

	echo '/c/Python25/python.exe /c/Python25/Lib/site-packages/cola/bin/git-cola' >> /usr/bin/cola
	echo 'c:\\Python25\\python.exe c:\\Python25\\Lib\\site-packages\\bin\\git-cola' > /c/Windows/System32/cola.bat

This assumes the you have Python/PyQt4 installed in C:/Python25.
If this is not the case simply edit the commands accordingly.

voila, cola on Windows.


NOTE: Windows is not the developer's primary platform.
Patches are greatly appreciated.
