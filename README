REQUIREMENTS

Python 2.4 or newer
PyQt 4.3 or newer


INSTALLATION

If you downloaded a tarball, run:
/path/to/ugit-x.y.z/bin/ugit.py

If for some reason ugit.py is unable to locate its
libraries, add its site-packages directory to your $PYTHONPATH:

PYTHONPATH=/path/to/ugit-x.y.z/lib/python2.4/site-packages
export PYTHON
/path/to/ugit-x.y.z/bin/ugit.py


BUILDING FROM SOURCE

./configure --prefix=/usr
make && sudo make install


WINDOWS SUPPORT

Windows supported is experimental at its the worst, and
o.k. at its best.  This is purely because Linux is the
author's primary platform.  Any help is greatly appreciated,
especially with bugs/troubleshooting.

The following is the combination that "works for me"(TM)
as of late 2007:

1) Install the native Python2.5 and PyQt4 installers (in that order):

	http://python.org/download/
	http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/download.php

3) Install git (the author had the best luck with msysgit):

	http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/WindowsInstall

4) Download and unpack ugit:
	http://ugit.justroots.com/

Grab the latest -win32 tarball and run either ugit-msysgit.sh or ugit-cygwin.sh
from within an msysgit (or cygwin) shell.

The script assumes the you have Python/PyQt4 installed in C:\Python25.
If this is not the case, edit the script accordingly.

voila, ugit on Windows.
