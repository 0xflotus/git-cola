BUILDING FROM SOURCE

    git clone git://gitorious.org/git-cola/mainline.git cola
    make prefix=/usr install


INSTALLATION

Debian and RPM users can download freshly built binaries here:

    http://cola.tuxfamily.org/releases/


If you downloaded a tarball, make sure /path/to/cola/bin is in your $PATH.


HOW TO RUN

Take your pick--any of the following incantations work from the command line:

    git cola
    git-cola
    cola

Launching cola on repositories outside your $CWD:

    git cola /repo/path-1 /repo/path-2 .. /repo/path-N


STYLESHEETS

    git cola ships with an alternative stylesheet called "dark".
    You can use this stylesheet by running:

        git cola --style=dark


    You can also skin git cola by providing your own Qt stylesheet:

        git cola --style=/path/to/my/style.qss


    An example stylesheet is provided in:

        $PREFIX/share/cola/styles/dark.qss


WINDOWS INSTALLATION

1) Install the native Python2.5 and PyQt4 installers (in that order):

    http://python.org/download/
    http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/download.php

3) Install msysgit:

    http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/WindowsInstall

4) Install the GnuWin32 'file' command:

    http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/file.htm

    Add the installed directory (default: c:\GnuWin32\bin) to your path.

5) Install simplejson

    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson

6) Download cola:

    http://cola.tuxfamily.org/releases/

7) Install cola (from a Git Bash):

    cd /c/Python25/Lib/site-packages
    tar xvfz /path/to/cola-win32-*.tar.gz
    mv cola-win32-* cola

8) Create an executable in your path for bash, cmd.exe, or both:

    echo '/c/Python25/python.exe /c/Python25/Lib/site-packages/cola/bin/git-cola' >> /usr/bin/cola
    echo 'c:\\Python25\\python.exe c:\\Python25\\Lib\\site-packages\\bin\\git-cola' > /c/Windows/System32/cola.bat

This assumes the you have Python/PyQt4 installed in C:/Python25.
If this is not the case simply edit the commands accordingly.

voila, cola on Windows.


NOTE: Windows is not the developer's primary platform.
Patches are greatly appreciated.
