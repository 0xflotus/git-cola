git-cola v2.1.1 (BETA)
======================
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* A new "Find files" widget was added, and can be activated by
  using the `Ctrl+t` or `t` hotkeys.

* A new `git cola find` sub-command was added for finding files.

* `git cola` now remembers the text cursor's position when staging
  interactively with the keyboard.  This makes it easier to use the keyboard
  arrows to select and stage lines.

* The completion widgets will now select the top completion item
  when `Enter` or `Return` are pressed.
