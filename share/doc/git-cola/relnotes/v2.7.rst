.. _v2.7:

git-cola v2.7 (pre-release)
===========================

Fixes
-----

* When repositories stored in non-ASCII, UTF-8-encoded filesystem paths
  were operated upon with `LC_ALL=C` set in the environment, unicode errors
  would occur when using `python2`.  `git cola` was made more robust and will
  now operate correctly within this environment.

Development
-----------

* The `unittest.mock` module is now used instead of the original `mock` module
  when running the `git cola` test suite using Python3.
