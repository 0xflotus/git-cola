.. _v2.7:

git-cola v2.7 (pre-release)
===========================

Development
-----------

* The `unittest.mock` module is now used instead of the original `mock` module
  when running the `git cola` test suite using Python3.

  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/569


Packaging
---------

* `git cola` now depends on *QtPy* and includes a bundled copy of the
  `qtpy` library.  If you are packaging `git cola` and would prefer to use
  `qtpy` from your distribution instead of the built-in version then use
  `make NO_VENDOR_LIBS=1` when building `git cola`.  This will prevent
  vendored libraries from being installed.
