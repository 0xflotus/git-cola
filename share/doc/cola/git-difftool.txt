NAME
----
git-difftool - compare changes using common diff tools

SYNOPSIS
--------
'git difftool' [--tool=<tool>] [--no-prompt] ['git diff' options]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
'git-difftool' is a git command that allows you to compare and edit files
between revisions using common diff tools.  At its most basic level,
'git-difftool' does what 'git-mergetool' does but its use is for non-merge
situations such as when preparing commits or comparing changes against
the index.

'git difftool' is a frontend to 'git diff' and accepts the same
arguments and options.

See linkgit:git-diff[1] for the full list of supported options.

OPTIONS
-------
-t <tool>::
--tool=<tool>::
	Use the diff program specified by <tool>.
	Valid diff tools are:
	kdiff3, kompare, tkdiff, meld, xxdiff, emerge,
	vimdiff, gvimdiff, ecmerge, and opendiff
+
If a diff program is not specified, 'git-difftool'
will use the configuration variable `diff.tool`.  If the
configuration variable `diff.tool` is not set, 'git difftool'
will pick a suitable default.
+
You can explicitly provide a full path to the tool by setting the
configuration variable `difftool.<tool>.path`. For example, you
can configure the absolute path to kdiff3 by setting
`difftool.kdiff3.path`. Otherwise, 'git-difftool' assumes the
tool is available in PATH.
+
Instead of running one of the known diff programs,
'git-difftool' can be customized to run an alternative program
by specifying the command line to invoke in a configuration
variable `difftool.<tool>.cmd`.
+
When 'git-difftool' is invoked with this tool (either through the
`-t` or `--tool` option or the `diff.tool` configuration variable)
the configured command line will be invoked with the following
variables available: `$PRE` is set to the name of the temporary
file containing the contents of the diff pre-image and `$POST`
is set to the name of the temporary file containing the contents
of the diff post-image.  `$FILENAME` is set to the file name.

--no-prompt::
	Do not prompt before launching a diff tool.

CONFIG VARIABLES
----------------
diff.tool::
	The default diff tool to use.
+
See the `--tool=<tool>` option above for more details.

merge.keepBackup::
	The original, unedited file content can be saved to a file with
	a `.orig` extension.  Defaults to `true` (i.e. keep the backup files).

difftool.<tool>.path::
	Override the path for the given tool.  This is useful in case
	your tool is not in the PATH.

difftool.<tool>.cmd::
	Specify the command to invoke the specified diff tool.
+
See the `--tool=<tool>` option above for more details.


SEE ALSO
--------

	'git-difftool' is part of the 'git-cola' project.

	Run merge conflict resolution tools to resolve merge conflicts

NOTE: Patches to add 'git-difftool' to git.git's contrib area
have been sent to the git mailing list.  Packagers are encouraged
to use git.git's contrib/difftool/ scripts instead of the ones
distributed with cola.  If git decides to make difftool part of
its core command set then cola will promptly add build rules to
conditionally install difftool based on the user's git version.
