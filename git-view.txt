This is the exact situation that the 'git view' builtin alias was
designed for. If every porcelain which spawned a viewer used 'git view',
then the user would only need to configure one place (but note that 'git
view' has never even made it out of next, so I am not recommending it
instead of your patch, but just making a note).
